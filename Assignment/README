Assignment Assignment

1. Too often programmers are stifled creatively in collegiate programming classes since they're required to follow a set syntax that's been in place for decades. This assignment is a breath of fresh air that will allow future students to express their creative side and themselves and what they're interested. They may even find fellow classmates who share similar interests and bonds can be formed. 

Also, this will help with preparation for the final group project as it leads up to it. I felt as though many students had no clue on what they wanted to do. Not only could they get a solid foundation and jump on the project, they might create a serious project worthy of an actual app store. Who knows the next big business partners could be in the same classroom but since there's no interaction between each other they could never meet!

2. 30 points total:
10 - Grammar and language
Reason: Proposals and customers expect a well-thought out project that is free of simple errors like misspellings.
Markdowns for: Misspelled words, grammar/language mistakes, not long enough to clearly express the idea

20 - Development of Idea
Reason: No one wants to spend time scrolling past "shovelware" on an app store. Thus, no one should have to even look at a application that clearly was well thought out.
Markdowns for: Copy of already-existing idea and no attempt to individualize it; Main idea for app is not clear; 

-10 pts for turning in late or submitted in the wrong format
