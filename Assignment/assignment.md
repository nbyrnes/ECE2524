Assignment Assignment

Homework X

Introduction
If you take a look at the app store on your smartphone youll find thousands of applications consisting of games, utilities, and countless other genres. You would think itd be futile to try to create an app of your own; my idea was probably already taken! Youd say to discourage yourself as you admit defeat. This is false however, new, successful games appear every week that have an original idea. This assignment could be the start of the next great app like Angry Birds, Draw Something, or Google Maps!

You may wish to use this idea as a starting point for the end of the year group project!


Problem (30 points)
Create an original idea for an application that you wish you had or could play on your smartphone. Or if you wish, drastically expand on an existing application by adding new functionality to make it more useful, user-friendly, or fun!

1. Write a paragraph or two that introduces your application that would appeal to a consumer surfing an app store. 
2. Answer the following questions:
For a utility: (Examples already done: calculator, GPS, etc.)
Why is it needed? What purpose does it serve?

For a game: (Examples already done: Solitaire, racing games, etc.)
Is there already a game like this?
If yes, what sets it apart from its predecessor?
What is the basic gameplay like?

Feel free to address any other concerns/questions you think may arise from a consumer and include your answers to those as well.
